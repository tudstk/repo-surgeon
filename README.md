# Repo Surgeon

Repo Surgeon is a local-first, human-controlled coding assistant for understanding and safely changing Git repositories.

## Implemented status

This checkout provides an executable foundation: a typed FastAPI process, a strict TypeScript and Next.js frontend, local PostgreSQL through Docker Compose, and CI quality gates. It also registers an existing local Git working tree and persists its resolved canonical root. The implemented API exposes process health plus repository registration and retrieval.

Registration validates only the selected path and Git worktree boundary. It does not read repository source files, index a repository, expose MCP tools, clone URLs, mutate the connected repository, run a sandbox, invoke a model, or implement a patch workflow or approval system. The frontend remains a visual shell with static example repositories, activity, tests, and diff content. See [product scope](docs/product/scope.md) for the broader roadmap.

No model API key is required.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.14.x and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) 0.12.9.
- Node.js 22.22.2 or newer in the 22.x line and pnpm 10.8.x. The supported ranges are in [frontend/package.json](frontend/package.json).
- curl for health checks.
- Docker Engine and Docker Compose only when starting local PostgreSQL.

Use the committed lockfiles. Do not update dependencies during setup.

## Start PostgreSQL and apply migrations

Repository registration persists records in PostgreSQL. Start the local database before starting the backend:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d postgres
docker compose exec postgres pg_isready -U repo_surgeon -d repo_surgeon
cd backend
uv sync --locked
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

The default `REPO_SURGEON_DATABASE_URL` matches Compose. Set it only when connecting to a different local PostgreSQL database. `docker compose down` preserves data; `docker compose down -v` intentionally removes the local database volume.

## Start the backend

From the repository root:

```sh
cd backend
uv sync --locked
uv run uvicorn repo_surgeon.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The API listens on `127.0.0.1:8000`. In another terminal, run the health checks:

```sh
curl --fail --silent --show-error http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/live
curl --fail --silent --show-error http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/ready
```

They return `{"status":"live"}` and `{"status":"ready"}`. Readiness remains dependency-free: it does not check PostgreSQL, repositories, a sandbox, or a provider. FastAPI documentation is available at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>.

## Register a local repository

After migrations are applied, send an absolute path to an existing Git working tree. The API resolves symlinks and persists Git's canonical top-level root; repeated requests for the same worktree return the same record.

```sh
curl --fail --show-error \
  --request POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/repositories \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"path":"/absolute/path/to/a/git-working-tree"}'
```

Use the returned `id` to retrieve the record:

```sh
curl --fail --show-error http://127.0.0.1:8000/repositories/<id>
```

Invalid roots and malformed repository requests return `application/problem+json` with a stable `code`. Registration never reads source files or modifies the selected worktree.

## Start the frontend

```sh
cd frontend
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The rendered workspace data is static preview content and does not invoke the backend or perform agent actions.

## Verify quality gates

These are the commands enforced by [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml):

```sh
cd backend
uv sync --locked
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src tests
uv run pytest
```

```sh
cd frontend
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

The workflow runs on pushes and pull requests. It uses `backend/uv.lock` and `frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml`, then checks backend formatting, linting, strict typing, and tests plus frontend formatting, linting, type checking, tests, and production build.

## Learn the foundation

The registration request path is `curl -> Uvicorn ASGI server -> FastAPI router -> application use case -> SQLAlchemy adapter -> PostgreSQL`. The frontend is independent. Read the [architecture baseline](docs/architecture/overview.md), [C# and Python concept map](docs/learning/glossary.md), and [Milestone retrospectives](docs/learning/milestone-retrospectives.md).

Future work begins with bounded safe file reading. Model providers, MCP, repository indexing, test sandboxing, proposals, approvals, patch application, audits, and pull requests are roadmap only.
